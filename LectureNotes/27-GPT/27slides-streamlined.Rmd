# ChatGPT: What you already know

Most of you are familiar with ChatGPT and similar chat interfaces:

- Web-based chat at chat.openai.com (and similar: Claude.ai, Gemini, etc.)

- You ask questions, it responds

- Great for: explaining concepts, brainstorming, quick coding help, editing text

- .hi[Key limitations:]
    - No access to your files or codebase
    - Can't run code or tests
    - Each conversation starts fresh
    - Manual copy-paste workflow between AI and your project

.hi[The 2026 landscape:] GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek R1

- All share the same basic chat paradigm

- Freemium model; ~$20/month for full features



---
# The evolution: AI Agents

Moving beyond simple question-and-answer:

- .hi[Traditional chat LLMs:] You ask, they answer (one-shot)

- .hi[AI Agents:] Given a goal, they autonomously take steps to achieve it

.pull-left[
.hi[Chat workflow:]
- You describe task in detail
- AI gives you code/text
- You copy-paste into project
- You run it and check
- If broken, back to chat...
- Repeat until it works
]

.pull-right[
.hi[Agent workflow:]
- You describe the goal
- AI explores your project
- AI writes code in your files
- AI runs tests to verify
- AI iterates until successful
- You review final result
]

Agents use tools (read files, run code, git), iterate and reason, and verify their own work



---
# What is Claude Code?

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - Anthropic's AI coding agent for research and development:

- .hi[Not a chat interface] - it's a command-line tool (CLI) in your terminal

- .hi[Works directly on your files] - reads, writes, edits your actual codebase

- .hi[Operates autonomously] - you give it goals, it figures out the steps

.hi[Key capabilities:]
- Explore and understand existing codebases
- Read, write, and edit multiple files
- Run code, tests, and terminal commands
- Create git commits and pull requests
- Install dependencies and fix errors
- Iterate on tasks until successful

Free tier available; $20/month for Claude Pro (5x usage)

# ChatGPT vs Claude Code: Side-by-side

| Feature | ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Interface | Web browser | Terminal/CLI |
| File access | None (copy-paste) | Direct access to your files |
| Code execution | Can't run code | Runs code, tests, commands |
| Workflow | One question at a time | Multi-step autonomous tasks |
| Context | Single conversation | Full codebase exploration |
| Best for | Quick questions, ideas | Complex projects, refactoring |
| Integration | Standalone | Works with git, npm, R, Python |
| Academic use | Brainstorm, explain, edit | Data analysis, code, automate |

# When to use ChatGPT vs Claude Code

.pull-left[
.hi[Use ChatGPT when:]
- Quick explanations
- Brainstorming ideas
- Text editing
- Single code snippets
- No file access needed
]

.pull-right[
.hi[Use Claude Code when:]
- Multi-file coding tasks
- Data cleaning pipelines
- Creating figures/tables
- Documentation generation
- Building replication packages
- .hi[Running code in your environment]
]



---
# Getting started with Claude Code

.hi[Installation (takes 2 minutes):]

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
curl -fsSL https://cli.claude.ai/install.sh | sh
claude auth login
```

.hi[Start using it:]

```bash
cd ~/my-research-project
claude
```

.hi[Example prompts:]
```
analyze this codebase and explain what it does
create publication-ready figures from my plots
generate regression tables for all models
organize messy scripts into logical folders
```

# Why academics should care

.hi[AI agents are transforming research productivity:]

- [Joshua Gans](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/the-rotman-experience/our-community/people/gans-joshua/) had o1 write a paper [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176525000461?via%3Dihub) in *Economics Letters*

- Gans argues: research could become cheaper than search - why look up papers when AI can generate research on demand?

.hi[My own experience (October 2024):]

- Created a working paper in health economics far outside my expertise ([link](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17390/are-vegetable-seed-oils-fueling-the-obesity-epidemic))

- Would not have been possible pre-2024

- Used: Elicit (lit review), GPT-4/Claude (coding), Claude (explanations, writing)

- .hi[With Claude Code, this would have been even faster and easier]

# Research tasks Claude Code excels at

.pull-left[
.hi[Data and analysis:]
- Clean and merge datasets
- Run specs and create tables
- Implement estimators
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Format conversion (Stata/R/Python)

.hi[Visualization:]
- Publication-ready figures
- Coefficient plots
- Flowcharts
]

.pull-right[
.hi[Documentation:]
- Add code comments
- Create replication packages
- Generate data dictionaries
- Organize file structures

.hi[LaTeX and writing:]
- Word → LaTeX conversion
- Beamer presentations
- Regression tables
- Debug compilation errors

# Live Demonstration

### From Messy Data to Publication-Ready Analysis

### Using Claude Code for end-to-end research workflow

(30 minutes)

# Other AI tools for academic research

Claude Code is powerful, but specialized tools exist:

.hi[Literature review:]
- [Elicit.org](https://elicit.org/) and [Consensus.app](https://consensus.app/) - search and synthesize papers
- [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) - create podcasts, slides, and summaries from PDFs

.hi[Code completion in your editor:]
- GitHub Copilot - inline suggestions (free for academics!)
- Works in VS Code, RStudio; great for LaTeX/RMarkdown writing

.hi[Search and writing:]
- [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) - AI search with citations
- [lex.page](https://lex.page) - AI-augmented writing
- Microsoft Copilot - Word, PowerPoint integration

.hi[Recommendation:] Use Claude Code for coding/analysis; combine with other tools for complete workflow



---
# What I've used LLMs for in my research

.small[
- Fill out bureaucratic forms
- Write code that automates grading
- Write code that systematizes data analysis (for replication)
- Write code to create data visualizations
- Write unit tests of code
- Prepare discussion slides for conferences
- Prepare peer review reports
- Prepare slide decks (including this one!)
- Reduce word count of abstracts
- Improve sentence clarity in papers
- Write survey questions that methodologists would approve of
- Explain poorly written abstracts/papers in simpler terms
- Invert mathematical functions
- Debug LaTeX compilation errors
- Convert between data formats (Stata ↔ R ↔ Python)
- Create research design flowcharts
- ... not to mention personal life applications

# Pro tips and best practices

.hi[Effective prompting:]
- Be specific: ❌ "Fix my code" ✅ "Fix data import error in clean_data.R"
- Let it explore: "Explore project, then create regression tables"
- Multi-step: "Clean data, run analysis, create figures, organize outputs"

.hi[Documentation:]
- Create CLAUDE.md files for future AI sessions
- Add comprehensive comments to scripts
- Generate READMEs with setup instructions

.hi[Best practices:]
- Always verify output - agents make mistakes
- Use git/version control to revert changes
- Be careful with sensitive data
- Be transparent about AI use
